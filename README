This is a test of the SDL libraries on the Android platform.

It currently has working versions of the SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, and SDL_ttf libraries.

Your sources go into jni/src, and you should edit jni/src/Android.mk to include them.

It is currently set up to build the aliens demo, and you should run data.sh to push the data to the device, before you run it.

You build with ndk-build, and install to the device with: ant install

For a full README, see README.android in the SDL source archive.
